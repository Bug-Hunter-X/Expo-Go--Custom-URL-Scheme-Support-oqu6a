Instead of directly using a custom URL scheme, consider using a different approach such as deep linking with a supported scheme (like `http` or `https`) which Expo Go is capable of handling.  Alternatively, test the custom URL scheme handling functionality on a physical device or emulator after building your app with `expo build`.
